# ADC
The main architecture and loss function for the adversarial single-domain generalization method has been uploaded, just run the main function.

While the core components necessary to reproduce the method are already available, we are currently organizing and refining the remaining parts of the codebase. Additionally, the experimental results presented in the paper will also be gradually updated in the repository. We appreciate your understanding and will ensure timely completion of the updates to support reproducibility and further research.
