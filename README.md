# 🛠️ Data preprocessing
The raw input data consists of **vibration acceleration signals**. We do not apply any additional preprocessing steps such as denoising or normalization. 

- Each sample is extracted by segmenting the original signal into fixed-length (2048) windows.
- A Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is applied to each segment during data loading, implemented in `load_data.py`.

This ensures that the entire pipeline is simple, reproducible, and focused on frequency-domain representations only.

# 🧪 Environment Setup
This project is developed and tested under Python 3.9 with PyTorch 1.12.

We recommend using `conda` to manage the environment for consistent dependencies.

# 🚀 Quick Start

A sample dataset and a ready-to-run script are provided to facilitate quick and easy implementation for users.

1. **Preparing data**.
- Option 1: To help users get started quickly, we provide three pre-segmented sample sets of vibration signals from the PU dataset, corresponding to three different operating conditions:

- `PU_0900_1000_07.mat`
- `PU_1500_0400_07.mat`
- `PU_1500_1000_01.mat`

These `.mat` files are already uploaded to this repository root and can be used directly without any preprocessing. They are representative of different operating conditions and fault types.
- Option 2: Download the data manually from: [📥 External download link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Ok5xu_rYZKq47lokK3_Oad4XsGGixOSc?usp=drive_link)

2. **Please modify the dataset loading path in the code (`main.py`) to match the actual location where you store the .mat files on your machine**.

3. **Clone this repository**.
   
4. **Run the** `main.py` **file to start training and evaluation**.
